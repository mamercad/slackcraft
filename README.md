Slack and Minecraft stuffs

* slacknotify.py - Runs forever, point it at your Minecraft rcon and give a Slack webhook URL. Currently dumps the list of players to Slack (when this information changes). Easy way to know when people are all up in your Minecraft server without having to stare at the server console. In Slack, you can adjust your channel notification preferences so that you can be pinged about any changes in a channel, etc.
